The 3D Art Gallery is built using **React** and **React-Three-Fiber**. It provides an immersive, interactive gallery to showcase personal artwork. Users can explore various pieces, experience smooth transitions, view details of each artwork, and engage with a visually rich 3D environment. The application serves as a digital space for art exhibitions, making art accessible and captivating online.

## ‚ú® Features

- **3D Art Rendering**: Display of artwork in a 3D environment with realistic effects.
- **Dynamic Lighting**: Spotlights highlight individual pieces as users explore, creating a more lifelike gallery experience.
- **Interactive Mouse Movement**: The gallery responds to user interactions, enhancing the viewing experience.
- **Smooth Navigation**: Users can seamlessly scroll horizontally through the gallery.
